GUIs:

    Trainer card (with trainer card stars)

Field Effects:
    Spin tiles
    Waterfall
    Surf
    Bike
    Ledges
    Blocks that start scripts (bookshelves, tvs, PC, etc)
    Countertops that forward the script (mart employees)
    Repels
    Field moves

Data Stuff:
    Item pouches
    Dump TMHM compatibility
    Wild Pkmn with items

Nice to have (no priority):
    Changable tiles based on day/night
    Reflections on tiles
    Different day tints based on season
    Obj Following (#29)
    Attack animations
    Pass Powers
    Move relearner & Move tutor
    Feebas/Swarm/Roamer
    Mail
    Ribbons
    Weather visuals

Sounds cool but definitely not necessary at all:
    Color lookup tables for day tints
    Move/Item effect/data integration with battle engine (not needed because you can just clone and edit the battle engine to add these things and more, like new species/forms)
    Battle sprite shadows with rotation (like gen 5)
    Chatot special cry
