    Reflections
    Blocks that start scripts (bookshelves, tvs, PC, etc)
    Countertops that forward the script (mart employees)

Nice to have (no priority):
    Changable tiles based on day/night
    Different day tints based on season
    Obj Following (#29)
    Attack animations
    Pass Powers
    Move relearner & Move tutor
    Feebas/Swarm/Roamer

Sounds cool but definitely not necessary at all:
    Color lookup tables for day tints
    Move/Item effect/data integration with battle engine (not needed because you can just clone and edit the battle engine to add these things and more, like new species/forms)
    Battle sprite shadows with rotation (like gen 5)
